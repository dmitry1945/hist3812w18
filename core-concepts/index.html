<p>More readings will of course be provided, but these pieces together <em>in this reading order</em> set the stage for what we shall attempt to do in this course.</p>

<p>This work was produced for Jentery Sayer&rsquo;s ENGL508 at the University of Victoria. A 3rd year project by a Carleton student from a few years ago, <a href="https://ryanpickering.github.io/Residential-School-Online-Response/startbootstrap-grayscale-1.0.3/">&lsquo;Searching for Residential Schools&rsquo;</a> uses the same basic template, which adds another level to this idea of remixing&hellip;</p>

<p><a name="hypothesis"></a></p>

<h2 id="hypothesis">Hypothesis</h2>

<p>The majority of our readings are provided to you online. When you read online, please have the <a href="http://web.hypothes.is">Hypothesis web annotation plugin</a> installed (the link goes to the Hypothesis website). You should also consult <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/quick-start-guide-for-students/">The Quickstart Guide for Students</a>. You do not need to use your own name as a username with Hypothes.is; but you <strong>should</strong> let Dr. Graham know what your username is so your work can be credited appropriately.</p>

<p>Make your annotations to the <a href="https://hypothes.is/groups/MP67BLk7/hist3812w2018">Critical Making in Digital History</a> reading group (the link takes you to the &lsquo;join the group&rsquo; page). You can respond to others&rsquo; annotations, link outwards from an annotation to another website or resource, or link <em>to</em> an annotation from another location. Annotations are visible to anyone who joins the group. <strong>Appropriate public behaviour is expected at all times</strong>. Trolling, shaming, or abusive behaviour will not be tolerated.</p>

<p><a name="notebook"></a></p>

<h2 id="open-notebook">Open Notebook</h2>

<p>You will need to keep an open notebook of your experiments and your thinking in this class. You will do this by using a popular versioning control and collaboration website, <a href="http://github.com">Github.com</a>. Sign up for an account; you do not need to use your own name. To start, you will create a repository, initialized with a &lsquo;readme.md&rsquo; file, called &lsquo;Notebook&rsquo;. Over the duration of the course you may end up creating many more. (You do not necessarily have to install Git on your own computer, at least for now).</p>

<p><a name="resources"></a></p>

<h2 id="computing-resources">Computing Resources</h2>

<p>You are welcome to use your own laptops or desktops. You can use the computers in the Underhill Resource Room in the Department of History (but check in with Dr. Graham first). You can use the public computers in the Library or any of the public computing labs. I would not recommend trying to do everything via an iPad or other tablet, though it might be possible. You may need to use a mobile phone from time to time. If you don&rsquo;t have one, you can team up with someone else.</p>

<p>If you have any concerns, contact Dr. Graham as soon as possible.</p>

<p><a name="fail"></a></p>

<h2 id="when-things-go-wrong-technically-speaking">When things go wrong, technically speaking</h2>

<p>This is a digital history class. <strong>Things will break</strong>. The <em>ways</em> things break are instructive and opportunities for reflection and learning. I <em>expect</em> you to be flummoxed by what we&rsquo;re doing. I also expect you to <em>be honest</em> about when things don&rsquo;t go the way you&rsquo;re expecting. For more on this outlook on digital work, see <a href="https://digitalpedagogy.mla.hcommons.org/keywords/failure/">this essay by Croxall and Warnick, especially the &lsquo;curatorial statement&rsquo;</a>.</p>

<p><a name="collaboration"></a></p>

<h2 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h2>

<p>I welcome collaboration. If you decide to collaborate with one (or at most, two) of your peers, I encourage that. Digital History is indeed a team sport. All collaboration must be fully and mindfully credited on any work that is completed. My expectation is that people who collaborate are able to produce a correspondingly greater piece of work. <strong>Collaborative teams should schedule an appointment with Dr. Graham</strong> as soon as possible so that he can help you lay out ground rules for your collaboration.</p>

<p>You are welcome to complete this course on your own, of course.</p>

<p><a name="privacy"></a></p>

<h2 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>You are in no way obligated to do any of the public-facing work of this course under your own name. Pseudonyms are ok. You do not need to explain why you want to use a pseudonym to me. At all times, keep your own personal safety online front and centre: my experience of the internet, and of academic culture, will have been different from yours, and my goal is to listen more than I talk when it comes to these issues.</p>

<p>If you wish to use a pseudonym for your <strong>Hypothesis</strong> and <strong>Github</strong> accounts, simply send a note to Dr. Graham telling him the account name.</p>
